- **Performance scalability**: Plan for horizontal scaling architecture
- **Data quality issues**: Implement robust validation and error handling

### User Experience Risks

- **Over-complicated plans**: Focus on simplicity and user testing
- **Injury liability**: Clear disclaimers and conservative progressions
- **Privacy concerns**: Transparent data handling and user control

### Personal Use Risks

- **Over-reliance on automation**: Encourage user understanding of training principles
- **Garmin API dependency**: Develop graceful handling of service interruptions
- **Training load accuracy**: Conservative approach to prevent overtraining

### Technical Implementation Risks

- **Workout Provider Filtering**: Need to validate that Garmin API supports reliable filtering by `workoutProvider` field for plan identification
- **Plan Version Control**: Verify `trainingPlanId` approach works for tracking plan modifications
- **Author Field Manipulation**: Confirm that setting custom author information doesn't conflict with Garmin's data validation

This roadmap provides a comprehensive path from the current solid foundation to a full-featured local AI running coach that seamlessly integrates with Garmin Connect through Claude Desktop, optimized for personal use without external dependencies.
