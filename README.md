# trainme (WIP)

Conversational running trainer that syncs back to garmin.

## quickstart

```shell
# python >= 3.11.5
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 .
```

## TODOs

- Better feedback loop to claude to ensure it does what you ask (creates 5 week plan when not asked, not 3 week plan)
- Confirmation of plan and upload activities to Garmin
- Better plan generation - some of the workouts created do not look good
